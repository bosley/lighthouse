Priority high-low:
    - Consider moving the DB stuff in server into ds (where it should be) and make a nice interface to the db
    - analytics on endpoint usage
    - admin panel for viewing everything

When we need to:
    - Modify the db to use TURSO instead of a local sqlite db

Rainy day/ never going to happen:
    - Neat to add TCP/quik/ipfs
